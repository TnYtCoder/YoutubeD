A Simple Python Tool To Download Youtube Video In Seconds 👾

You Can Even Select The `Quality` Of The Video.

I've Created This Tool Using `youtubedr`
Pkg With Familiar Interface Where You Don't Need To Enter Codes☺️

## Installation (Termux)

For First `Run` This In Your Termux -->

```
apt update
apt upgrade
pkg install git
pkg install python
pkg install bash
```

`These Are Required To Run This Tool ☝️`

Lets `Download` The Tool Into Your Termux -->

```
git clone https://github.com/TnYtCoder/YoutubeD
cd YoutubeD
bash install.sh
```

You Have To Install The `Requirements To Avoid The Unwanted Errors`. 

To Start The Process Run -->

```
bash start.sh
```

Here You Go ! 
> You Started The Video Downloader In Your Termux.

If You Want To Move That Video Clip To Your Local Storage Then Use This Command -->


```
mv FILENAME /sdcard
```

> This Command Will Automatically Move Your Downloaded File To Your Sdcard

## Not To Do 
`Do Not Remove Any File Or Change Anything Init. This Will Make Files Useless & You Have Many Errors`

`Your Downloaded Video Will Visible In "YoutubeD" Folder, So Don't Make Changes In That Folder.`

`Do Not Rename "config" folder, because .sh cannot recognise the renamed folder`

`Do Not Uninstall Any Pkg To Avoid Error`
